## About Me

I’m a student building hands-on technical skills through real projects.  
Right now, I’m focused on:

- Learning Linux and Python through Raspberry Pi
- Building strong GitHub habits (documentation, commits, progress tracking)
- Preparing for future robotics, AI, and data-driven projects

I believe in learning **from the ground up** and documenting the process.

## Current Focus

🔹 Raspberry Pi fundamentals  
🔹 Linux terminal & system navigation  
🔹 Python scripting  
🔹 Git & GitHub workflow

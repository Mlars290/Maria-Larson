# Maria Larson

Hi! I’m Maria Larson — a B.S. Data Science student at Metropolitan State University (Metro State).

I’m focused on data analytics, visualization, and applied AI, and I’m building a portfolio that shows both
statistical thinking and real-world projects.

## What I’m working on
- 📊 Data visualization + statistical analysis (R, tidyverse, ggplot2)
- 🧠 Intelligence & security analytics coursework + projects
- 💻 Building stronger CS foundations (Python, Linux) for applied AI/robotics

## Featured Projects
- **Audio Environment Study (R)** — analysis of how different audio environments impact study focus  
  Tools: R, tidyverse, ggplot2, ANOVA, Tukey HSD  
  Repo: *(add your link here)*

- **Raspberry Pi Basics** — learning Linux + Python on real hardware before robotics/AI projects  
  Repo: *(add your link here)*

## Skills
- **Languages:** R, Python (learning deeper)
- **Data:** tidyverse, ggplot2, basic statistical testing
- **Tools:** GitHub, Markdown, (Linux in progress)
